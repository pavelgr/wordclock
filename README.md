# WORDCLOCK

Just a small side project, e-ink display for a clock (wordclock [!] and other displays), weather (using AccuWeather API), images and reminders, controlled physically and over a Telegram bot.

Inspired by lots of previous art:



## V1: K3
- Uses a jailbroken Kindle K3 device (800x600, 8bit grayscale, no light, no touchscreen, 2.x kernel, custom rootfs)
- Device part implemented in bash



## V2: Glo HD (in the works)
- Uses a [liberated] Kobo Glo HD device (1448Ã—1072, 16bit grayscale, light, touchscreen, 3.15 kernel, Debian Jessie rootfs)
- Device part implemented in python
